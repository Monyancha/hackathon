##### What is a _hackathon_?

A hackathon is an event, typically lasting several days, in which a large number of people meet to engage in _collaborative_ computer programming.


##### Our goals for this hackathon?

- Building a developer community within campus.
- Create a hackathon (tech events) culture at USIU.
- _Mentor_ younger hackers; mentor/ mentee program.
- Build teams/ team building: Get attendees to work with others they may not regularly work with.
- Creative output: Give everyone the opportunity to get away from their desks and daily tasks to squeeze out their creative juices.
- Product development: Create working products or services.


##### What do I get?

- A **shirt** :)
- Snacks and Drinks throughout the event.
- You get to meet other developers and techies.
- Be part of building a new community.


##### Do I have to pre-organize a team?

No. We can try to help you find one at the event.


##### Why would I want to go to a Hackathon?

**Because you want to**: Hone your skills, connect with other developers that are passionate about building good software, learn about tools and new dev patterns, demonstrate your skills... and have a chance at wining cool prizes!


##### Hack? I'm a developer, not a security guy!

Relax. In the programming world, hacker means:
"A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and stretching their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.


##### Hackathon Guidelines

- Coding **must** take place during designated programming hours. No outside work allowed.
- Each team gets **5** minutes to present their project.
- Each project must be solving a problem identified in any area.
- **Bring your own device** (BYOD) laptop, tablet, testing device.
- We encourage teams to be composed of _two to five people_ - you need a good reason to work alone (**optional**).
- If and when voting occurs, each team must cast votes for **ANOTHER** team. No self-voting allowed! (for the audience choice award).
- Upon judging, no complaints can be made whatsoever: there choice is final.There will however be an audience choice.
- Participation awards - recognition on the IT club website for respective teams.
- **No running torrents** within the network or unnecessarily deteriorating the network.
- For those running hacking demos, be sure to get **permission** before penetrating a system or setup a virtual environment for your tests.
- Short demo and presentation, **5 slides max, 5 mins max**. Sharpen that elevator pitch.
- **No running torrents** within the network or unnecessarily deteriorating the network (Looking at you IDM users!).



##### How to survive a hackathon


- Have a _modest_ goal; a simple concept or app to build. Do one thing and do it well, concentrate on building a prototype, not a finished product! Build something simple; a finished product is better than one that can't compile.
- Get enough rest, stay hydrated and just relax. Relax, take it easy, have fun! - [Mika](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVmG_d3HKBA)
- Set your tools - sublime-text, Netbeans, Jetbrains, VIM, Emacs ... etc your compilers and get your coding mojo.
- Clean your comp, fine tune it - _just get it working_.


#### I’m not a student, so how can I get involved?

Unfortunately, we can’t allow you to participate in the event or be on site during hacking. If you’re looking to mentor (i.e. someone with *technical skills* who’d be willing to help out participants during the weekend), you should reach out to us at **usiuhackathon@gmail.com**. Otherwise, you can see the finished products at the demos(see the schedule below).


##### Have an Idea? / Do I need to be a programmer?

Not really, the hackathon is open to techies and enthusiasts alike (programmers, devs).


##### Venue?

- School of Science Building - LT3.

The room has all the tools for a successful hackathon, reliable WiFi, microphone, speakers - sockets.


##### Who will attend? (must be USIU student)

USIU students who are: 
- Hackers and ideaters a like
- Techies
- Tech Enthusiasts


##### Pitching session (optional - to create teams)

- Pitch your idea to the attendees.
- Pitching takes **3** mins max - **no slides, no powerpoint!**
- Get to know members and form teams.
- If you don't have a team, listen to the pitches and join a team with a problem solving idea that interested you.
- Need help with your elevator pitch? [Scott](http://scottberkun.com/essays/38-how-to-pitch-an-idea/)



#### Demos

Everybody will be called back to the back into the main room, and the teams will get ready to show off their work.

- Each team will receive between three and five minutes to describe their problem, how they intend to solve it, and demo what they come up with. It’s a hard limit, and teams will be cut off if they go over the stipulated time.
- Q&A's are allowed after each teams presentation (or only allow the judges to ask questions if the time available is not be adequate)

**Keep things moving**: Part of the competition is being able to concisely describe what you did.


#### Judging criteria/ Scoring


With such an appealing grand prize on the line, we want to make sure that the judging criteria is as **transparent** and fair as possible. Given the time constraints and available resources, teams are not required to have a fully functioning demo of their product. Instead, everyone is given the breakdown of exactly what the scoring sheet will look like, so that they plan their presentations accordingly:

##### 60% of the score is calculated from peer scores:

##### 25% – Real World Application

- Does this product identify a real need, demand, or problem?
- Does this product solve the identified need, demand, or problem?

##### 25% – Concreteness

- Does the team identify clear customer segment(s)?
- Does the team present the Unique Value Proposition(s) clearly and effectively?
- Does the team effectively use channels to acquire new users and customers?
- Does the team present a strategy for customer relationships and retention?
- Overall, does the team thoroughly and persuasively present the product/service?

##### 10% – Uniqueness

- Is this idea a creative or new solution to a need or problem?
- Does the product innovate on **AT LEAST ONE** of the following?
(a) features
(b) design
(c) user interactions
(d) technical solutions

##### 40% of the score is calculated from our two guests’ scores:

##### 20% – Possibility and Feasibility

- Is it possible to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within 3 months?
- Is it a stand alone product that can be built with our own resources? Or does it require other contributing partners to complete the product?

##### 20% – Teamwork

- Did each team member participate?
- Does the team clearly demonstrate each member’s roles and responsibilities (R&R)?


#### Feedback

Feedback? - collection of feedback from the attendees. (just before the judges announce the winning team)

- On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy the USIU hackathon?
- Would you like to participate in another USIU hackathon in the future?
- Is there anything you didn’t like about the USIU hackathon?
- Is there anything you liked about the USIU hackathon?
- What would you like to _improve_ about the USIU hackathon in the future?


#### Metrics

- How many teams had finished products?
- Demographics of attendees? (age, country, gender)
- Attendee satisfaction?


#### Post-Event Follow Up

After the event, we will follow up with an email to all attendees thanking them for their attendance. We will provide information about follow-up events that might occur, such as future hackathons and meet-ups.


#### Schedule

The hackathon should last just under 10 hours. Not a lot of time, admittedly, but having a tighter deadline will make teams much more productive!
